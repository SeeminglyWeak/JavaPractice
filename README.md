# 🚀 Java Practice Projects

Welcome to my Java coding journey! This repository is a collection of hands-on programs I've written while learning Java — from basic algorithms to foundational data structures. Each project reflects a step forward in mastering logic, syntax, and problem-solving.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

The programs I built while practicing java language.

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

I'm currently studying Computer Science at MIT Bangalore and actively building my skills in Java, DSA, and backend development. This repo helps me:

- Track my progress
- Practice clean coding habits
- Prepare for internships and placements
- Share my learning with others

## 🔧 What's Next?

- Recursion-based solutions
- Sorting algorithms
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
- Mini projects like a CLI calculator or number games
